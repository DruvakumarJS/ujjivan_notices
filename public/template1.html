customers who are old / sick / incapacitated and are not willing to open or operate joint
accounts.

Types of old / sick / incapacitated customers
Customers who are old / sick / incapacitated fall under two categories:
a. A customer who is too old or ill to sign a cheque or cannot be physically present in the
bank to withdraw money from his or her account, but can put his or her thumb
impression on the cheque or withdrawal form.
b. A customer who is unable to be physically present in the bank and is also unable to
put his or her thumb impression on the cheque or withdrawal form due to certain
physical incapacities.

Operational Procedure

With a view to enabling old / sick / incapacitated customers to operate their bank accounts,
RBI has directed banks to follow the procedure as under:
(a) Wherever thumb or toe impression of the old / sick / incapacitated customer is
obtained, he or she should be identified by two independent witnesses known to the
bank, one of whom should be a responsible bank official.
(b) Where the customer cannot even he put his or her thumb or toe impression, and
would also not be able to be physically present in the bank, a mark can be obtained
on the cheque or withdrawal form and he or she should be identified by two
independent witnesses known to the bank, one of whom should be a responsible bank
official.
(c) The customer may also be asked to indicate to the bank as to who would withdraw
the amount from the bank on the basis of the cheque or withdrawal form as obtained
above and that person should be identified by two independent witnesses. The person
who would actually be drawing money from the bank should be asked to furnish his
or her full signature to the bank.

If a customer cannot sign a cheque or withdrawal form due to loss of both hands, the
signature can be made by means of a mark. The mark can be placed by the customer in any
manner, including toe impression as suggested. It can be by means of mark which anybody
can put on behalf of the person who has to sign, the mark being put by an instrument which has
had a physical contact with the person who has to sign, as held by the Supreme Court of India in
AIR 1950 â€“ Supreme Court 265.</div>
